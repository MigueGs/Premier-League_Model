# Premier-League_Model
"Predictive model for English Premier League outcomes using Random Forest, featuring data analysis and performance insights."ðŸ¤–



Built a Random Forest model to predict English Premier League match winners. I scraped match data using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas, cleaned and prepped it for machine learning, and used scikit-learn to make predictions. I also evaluated errors and fine-tuned the model to improve accuracy. A hands-on journey through data scraping, cleaning, and predictive modeling!
